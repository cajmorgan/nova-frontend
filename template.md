### What is Nova?

Nova is an alternative to all those gigantic front-end frameworks, that often do more than is necessary when it comes to building simple UIs. Pure Vanilla Javascript is performance-wise the best way to build your front-end in a SPA, but it can be hard to organize it properly and as the project grows, it might end up very messy. This is where Nova comes in, being a lightweight library packed with functionality for creating and structuring UIs more easily.

### Features

Nova comes with most of the needed built-in features for handling a single-page application. Features like easily generating html, routing and state-management.

Nova is built solely on classes which are a perfect fit to handle context by storing the temporary data in a few places as possible. The topics that are necessary to understand are:

- Elements
- Components
- The Generator
- Groups
- State
- Router
