  "description": "Nova is an alternative to all those gigantic front-end frameworks, that often do more than is necessary when it comes to building simple UIs. Pure Vanilla Javascript is performance-wise the best way to build your front-end in a SPA, but it can be hard to organize it properly and as the project grows, it might end up very messy. This is where Nova comes in, being a lightweight library packed with functionality for creating and structuring UIs more easily.",
